\opening{Blue Origin}

\letterparagraph{
  My name is Aaron Rinehart, and I am interested in the role of Controls Engineer - New Glenn Autonomy with Blue Origin. I graduated in December 2021 with a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Toledo a little over a year ago. I am currently a Pre-feature Owner at Ford Motor Company. 
  In my current role I develop concept and system level requirements. I also have experience in V2X and ADAS validation and testing in my past work experience.

\letterparagraph{
  Since early in my college career my interest has been in autonomous controls which led me to the automotive industry with Hyundai and Ford. With my passion for autonomous controls and my skill set in both electrical and computer science engineering I believe I can be professionally successful and personally fulfilled in this role.

\letterparagraph{
  I have a personal acquaintance in Spencer Imbleau who works at Blue Origin as a Software Engineer. From our discussions about Blue Origin I feel that the company and the role would be a great fit for me. I would love your consideration for this role.
